Traktor Kontrol S3 MIDI mappings for Mixxxx (WIP)


This is a work in progress project. I'm trying to get [Mixxx](https://mixxx.org/) working for Traktor S3. Currently attempting the MIDI way, certain points are challenging (jog wheels + loop / move wheels). Learning as I go, any help appreciated.

## What works

* Play/Cue Decks A/B
* EQ and faders decks A/B
* Effect knobs decks A/B
* Gain decks A/B
* Master gain
* Headphone mix, headphone gain
* Headphone cue decks A/B
* Tempo faders decks A/B
* Keylock decks A/B
* Sync decks A/B
* Reverse mode decks A/B
* Toggle vinyl control decks A/B
* Library selector knob both decks
* Library load
* Library play
* View (maximize library)
* Crossfader
* Hotcues 1-4 decks A/B
* FX selectors (1/2 for deck A and 3/4 for deck B)

## What's missing

* Mixer fx on/off
* LEDs
* Decks C/D and the toggle buttons for those
* Jog wheel and scratching (my next attention point)
* Move and loop wheels (needs proper scripting to map)
* FLX, Hotcues/samples buttons

## What about HID?

Certainly Mixxx recommends using HID for NI devices, but the MIDI mode happens to work under Linux apparently so I'm not paying attention to it for now. Notice this is a personal project mostly, I definitely want to help out and share, but I will be the very first user of this :)

## Can I help?

Sure, if you have experience in writing Mixxx mappings please contact me, even if you don't have this controller, I definitely need a proper hand.

## License?

Do whatever you want, uh, CC0 actually.
